Project Description: Loan Approval Prediction
Objective:
The objective is to predict whether a loan will be approved (Loan_Status) based on certain applicant attributes using a Decision Tree Classifier.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains various features related to loan applicants:

Numerical Features: LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, etc.
Categorical Features: Gender, Married, Education, etc.
Target Variable: Loan_Status (whether the loan is approved or not).
This project involves predicting loan approval status using a Decision Tree Classifier on a dataset of loan applicants. The dataset contains both numerical features, such as `LoanAmount`, and categorical features, such as `Gender` and `Married`, with the target variable being `Loan_Status`. Missing values are handled by filling numerical columns with their mean and categorical columns with the mode. Categorical variables are encoded into numerical format using Label Encoding. A subset of features (`Credit_History`, `Gender`, `Married`, `Education`) is used to train the Decision Tree Classifier, which learns patterns in the data to predict loan approval. The model is evaluated on the training data using accuracy score, providing an initial measure of its performance. While the model achieves high accuracy on the training set, additional steps such as testing on unseen data, hyperparameter tuning, and expanding feature selection can improve its generalization and predictive power. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to streamline loan approval processes in financial services.
